# LLM foundations portfolio

Welcome. This site is the public landing page of my self-directed curriculum to build strong foundations in **Artificial intelligence**, **Machine learning**, **Deep learning** and **Large language models (LLMs)** in preparation for a Master's degree in AI at UT Austin.

## How to use this site

- Start with **Roadmap** to understand the 6-term structure, weekly cadence, and the deliverables expected at the end of each term.
- Use **Projects** to quickly review the portfolio repositories (one major deliverable per term) and their status.
- Use **Learning log** to see a chronological record of readings, exercises and experiments, with links to evidence.

## What this portfolio demonstrates

- **Breadth across AI foundations** (not only LLMs): supervised learning, deep learning fundamentals, NLP, optimisation, evaluation, and core software practices.
- **Depth in modern LLM systems**: transformers, practical LLM fine-tuning (PEFT), evaluation design, and end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.
- **Readiness for graduate coursework**: explicit coverage of typical prerequisites and admissions expectations (see **Mapping to prerequisites**).

## Fast review path

If you have limited time, a recommended review flow is:

1. **Projects** (1–2 minutes): identify the main artifacts.
2. **Mapping to prerequisites** (3–5 minutes): confirm coverage of core readiness areas.
3. **Roadmap** (3–5 minutes): understand the structure and progression.
4. **Learning log** (optional): verify consistency and depth.

A checklist version is available in **Review checklist**.
