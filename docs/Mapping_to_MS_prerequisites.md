# Mapping to typical MS AI prerequisites (evidence map)

This document maps typical MS-level AI prerequisites to evidence in this portfolio (projects, reports, and logs).
It is meant to be referenced in a CV/SOP to make preparation explicit and verifiable.

## Prerequisites map

| Area | Typical prerequisite | Evidence (repo / doc link) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Programming | Proficiency in Python, basic software engineering | `LEARNING_LOG.md`, project repos (tests, structure) | Planned |
| Data structures & algorithms | Big-O, arrays/lists, hash tables, trees/heaps, graph algorithms | `cs-fundamentals-for-ai` | Planned |
| Calculus | Derivatives, gradients (basic multivariate) | Track 2 notes + Term 1–2 exercises | Planned |
| Linear algebra | Matrices, projections, eigenvalues, SVD, PCA | Term 2 report (PCA on activations) | Planned |
| Probability | Random variables, expectation, conditional probability, CLT | Term 3 notes + token distribution analysis | Planned |
| Statistics & inference | Estimation, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests | Term 5 report (model comparisons with CI/tests) | Planned |
| Machine learning | Supervised learning, evaluation, regularisation | `ml-classic-portfolio` | Planned |
| Deep learning | Neural networks, optimisation, training stability | `dl-systems-basics`, `mini-transformer-lab` | Planned |
| NLP | Language modelling basics, embeddings | `text-corpus-and-tokenizer` | Planned |
| Transformers / LLMs | Transformer architecture, fine-tuning, evaluation | `mini-transformer-lab`, `llm-experiments-lab` | Planned |
| Reinforcement learning | Bandits, MDPs, Q-learning, policy/value methods | `rl-and-planning-foundations` | Planned |
| Systems / MLOps | Experiment tracking, reproducibility, deployment basics | Term 5–6 repos | Planned |
| Responsible AI | Ethics, safety, monitoring and mitigation | “Responsible AI” section in each report | Planned |

## How to use this document

- When a project is created, replace the evidence entry with a GitHub link.
- Update `Status` as: `Planned` → `In progress` → `Completed`.
- Keep this map consistent with `PROJECTS.md`.
