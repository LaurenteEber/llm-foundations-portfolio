# Learning log

This is a chronological log of readings, exercises and milestones.
The goal is to provide evidence of consistent work and to make progress reviewable.

**Update cadence (recommended):**
- Add 2–5 entries per week.
- Add a short term summary at the end of each month/term under `docs/terms/`.

## Log table
