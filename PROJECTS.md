# Projects overview

This table summarises the main public projects produced along this curriculum.
Each project is designed to be reviewed independently and includes:

- A clear `README.md` (in English) describing the problem, methods and results.
- A `docs/report.md` (or `report.pdf`) with a technical write-up.
- Clean code structure (even if small): `src/`, `notebooks/`, `configs/`, `tests/`.
- Basic tests (`pytest`) demonstrating engineering discipline.
- A short “Responsible AI” section in the report (limitations, risks, and mitigations).

## Foundation add-ons (pre-term)

| Module | Repository | Focus | Status | Evidence |

| A | `cs-fundamentals-for-ai` | Data structures, algorithms, complexity | Planned | link TBD |
| B | `rl-and-planning-foundations` | Bandits, MDPs, planning, Q-learning | Planned | link TBD |

## Term projects (1–6)

| Term | Repository | Focus | Status | Key skills demonstrated |

| 6 | `llm-rag-assistant` | LLM + RAG system with API & observability | Planned | RAG, serving, observability, safety and governance |

## How status is updated

- `Planned` → `In progress` → `Completed`
- Once created, replace `Repository` with a GitHub link, e.g.:

```text
[`ml-classic-portfolio`](https://github.com/laurenteeber/ml-classic-portfolio)
```
