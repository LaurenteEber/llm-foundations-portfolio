# LLM foundations portfolio

## Overview

This repository is the index (meta-repo) of my self-directed curriculum to build strong foundations in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) in preparation for a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at UT Austin.

It contains:

- A structured roadmap (6 terms / ~18 months).
- A learning log (readings, exercises, experiments and milestones).
- Links to project repositories that demonstrate skills in practice.
- A mapping from my preparation to typical MS AI prerequisites.

## Website

This meta-repository is also published as a GitHub Pages site:

- https://laurenteeber.github.io/llm-foundations-portfolio/

If you fork or rename the repository, update the URL accordingly.

## Background

- Undergraduate degree: Economics.
- Professional background: Strategic planning, monitoring and evaluation in the public sector (Peru).
- Current role: Specialist in monitoring and evaluation at CEPLAN (Centro Nacional de Planeamiento Estratégico).
- Motivation: Transition into AI/ML engineering and research, with a focus on reliable LLM-based systems and
  their applications to decision-making and policy analysis.

See `docs/Background_for_MS_in_AI.md` for a longer narrative.

## Curriculum structure

The curriculum runs three parallel tracks:

1. **Track 1 – Models and LLMs**
   - ML → Deep Learning → NLP → Transformers → practical LLMs → alignment/RAG.

2. **Track 2 – Mathematics and statistics**
   - Calculus, linear algebra, probability, statistics, optimisation, information theory,
     high-dimensional probability and generalisation.

3. **Track 3 – Engineering and MLOps for AI/LLMs**
   - Software engineering, data engineering for text, GPU/distributed training,
     experiment tracking, LLMOps, serving, observability, safety and responsible AI.

## Why LLMs (and why broader AI foundations too)

LLMs are a practical and widely deployed architecture today, and they provide an excellent “spine” for modern AI practice. However, to be fully prepared for graduate-level AI coursework, this curriculum explicitly includes:

- **CS fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, complexity)** – to support planning/search and systems reasoning.
- **Reinforcement learning and planning** – to cover core AI paradigms beyond supervised learning.
- **Responsible AI / ethics** – integrated as a deliverable in each major project report.

## Roadmap (high-level)

The detailed term-by-term plan is in `ROADMAP.md`. The main deliverables are the term projects below.

## Highlighted projects

### Foundation add-ons (pre-term)

- `cs-fundamentals-for-ai` – data structures, algorithms and complexity (BFS/DFS/A*, Dijkstra, heaps, hashing, Big-O).
- `rl-and-planning-foundations` – bandits + MDPs (value iteration) + Q-learning, plus evaluation and write-up.

### Term projects (1–6)

- **Term 1:** `ml-classic-portfolio` – classical ML project end-to-end (data → modelling → evaluation).
- **Term 2:** `dl-systems-basics` – modular deep learning system (PyTorch) + representation analysis (PCA).
- **Term 3:** `text-corpus-and-tokenizer` – text corpus pipeline + custom tokenizer + text classifier.
- **Term 4:** `mini-transformer-lab` – small transformer LM + training experiments + attention analysis.
- **Term 5:** `llm-experiments-lab` – fine-tuning / PEFT of an open-source LLM + rigorous evaluation + tracking.
- **Term 6:** `llm-rag-assistant` – end-to-end LLM + RAG system with API, logging, metrics and basic safety controls.

See `PROJECTS.md` for project status and repository links.
